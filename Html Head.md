# Lesson on the Head tag in HTML

The HTML head refers to everything in the &lt;head&gt; element.

the &lt;title&gt; vs &lt;h1&gt; - title is in the head element and referes to what the entire HTML document is about. The h1 element is title for that section or page. Would refer to what you are talking about. 

I am thinking that you could have a webpage about algebra. The title would be Mr.Smith's 6th grade algebra unit 4. Then the H1 would be Welcome to Finding the lowest common denominator.
