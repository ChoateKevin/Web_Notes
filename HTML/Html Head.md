# Lesson on the Head tag in HTML

The HTML head refers to everything in the &lt;head&gt; element.

the &lt;title&gt; vs &lt;h1&gt; - title is in the head element and referes to what the entire HTML document is about. The h1 element is title for that section or page. Would refer to what you are talking about. 

I am thinking that you could have a webpage about algebra. The title would be Mr.Smith's 6th grade algebra unit 4. Then the H1 would be Welcome to Finding the lowest common denominator. 

## Metadata

    I woud say this is data about the website. Instead of data for the website. So my book is about quokkas but the metadata would be the Author, how many pages, what font, who published it, etc.

    It can impact a website. If you had the language set wrong or didn't link the style sheet right the webdite would break.

    A cool meta tag attribute is name and content. Look at the following example 

    <meta name="Author" content="John Doe">

    We can use the name attribute to define the thing we are trying to describe and the use content to actually describe said thing. So in our example we said, Yo there is this thing called author and boom his name is John Doe. This way the crawlers find out webpage they are like ohh boy this is another John Doe webpage. Rank 1 for sure.

    You can add favicons to your website. This is what shows up in your tab or booksmark page next to the title.
