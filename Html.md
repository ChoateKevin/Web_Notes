# HTML Notes

## Intro Notes

    What does HTML answer? Why was it created? 
        I would imagine it answers how do we format text on a screen. Therefore a paragraph is not actually a paragraph. It just refers to a block of text. They dont know if I am using proper grammer. Everyone says HTML is like the foundation of a house or framing, but you could have an entire website with HTML you couldnt have an entire house without walls and functioning pipes. 

        I suppose HTML is just that. Structure for a website. It houses all of your content. While it may seem fancy with JS grabbing all your content off of a database and using a framework to generate thousands of components and filling in that content. At the end of the day it is HTML housing and showing that content and CSS making it look pretty. 

    I imagine the series of Elements that HTML uses to create websites is what inspired front end frameworks to be component based.

### Block vs Inline
    Block - Usually Structural and creates a new line. Think like Headers, paragraphs, things that you want to stand alone.

    Inline - Things that you want to stay within the flow. Not to start a new line. They stay "inline" with other elements.

    Block is going to be my header, while my navigation buttons are going to be inline within my header block. Dont for get block will move to the next line that is preceding it. 

    *This is in reference to HTML and is not block and inline in regards to CSS. This is saying what type of element it is. So <em> is a inline element while <p> is a block element.*

### Empty tags

    MDN refers to them as empty tags, I had always heard of them as self closing. But it is any tag that does not require a closing tag. the most common being <img>

### Attributes

    This is stuff that can tag a tag. haha. It is stuff you add to an element that helps give it anything style, function, alt text. It is unique because it is not seen by the user. It is within the opening tag like so <p class="">. it has to have a "attribute" an "=" sign and a value within "". 

    I have seen these used for a lot so far. I think they are inportant to modern web dev.
